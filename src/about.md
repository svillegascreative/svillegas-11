Hi, I’m sylvia villegas.

I am a primarily front-end developer from Toronto, working at a small development agency where I actually do so much more. I put together my design thinking, my eye for detail, my user empathy, my analytical mind, and my creative problem solving skills every day to help my team build awesome solutions that help businesses catalyze their growth, and <em>that’s pretty cool</em>.

## The Web
Web development is a long-time hobby I finally turned into a career after having built many project sites for myself. It is deeply satisfying to create the right solutions and improve online experiences, and so empowering to turn an idea into reality. If you have an online project that you want to get off the ground, or even a current website that needs nurturing, feel free to [get in touch]({% link contact.md %}) and maybe [we can work together]({% link work/web.md %}).

## The Horses
It’s true, many people associate me with horses. I’ve been riding for most of my life and have spent many years working with horses and riders, from beginner children at riding schools to professional showjumpers at international Grand Prix competitions across Canada and the US. I still offer top-tier [grooming services]({% link work/equine.md %}) to discerning horse owners, and love learning and sharing horse care tips.
