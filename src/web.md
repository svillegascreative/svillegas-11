title: Let’s Bring Your Web Project to Life

I believe in the Web as a tool: for sharing knowledge, for helping others, and for improving our own lives. Building things on the Web is my way of achieving these things for myself and for the users I aim to reach. Oh, and it can totally be fun, too.

## What can I help you with?

### Website Audit
Is your website not performing as well as it should? [Do you even know how well it’s performing?] Let’s have a close look at it and see what can be improved: usability, accessibility, content & copywriting, navigation, information architecture, performance, and aesthetics are all up for assessment. Identifying all the gains to be made, even small ones, will help you win big.

### Web Design
Trends come and go, but good design endures because, ultimately, it achieves its purpose. So, I’m not easily swayed by what’s hot right now or what the “Cool Kids” are doing; I go with what works best for you. Whether you need a new website or need to refresh an existing one, I can help you create a look and feel that is uniquely right for you, and that will help you achieve your goals on the Web.

### Web Development 
This is where the magic happens. I can build completely custom and unique experiences for your users, whether you need a few static landing pages, or a complete content management system to blog and update your site yourself.  with a focus on clean, semantic, and accessible code that is fast-loading and looks great.

### Custom Projects
Do you have any specific needs you think could be solved online but aren’t sure how to do it? Maybe a custom party invitation site with guest RSVP, or an app that tells you which blanket to put on your horse according to the current weather. Whatever your idea, I’m happy to explore it with you and make it come to life.
